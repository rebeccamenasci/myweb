# My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. The website has been customized to showcase information about me, including my background, education, employment history, hobbies, and more. It's designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of navigation.

## Key Files in the Repository

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
- `style.css`: The primary CSS file that controls the overall styling of the website.
- `navbar.css`: An additional CSS file specifically responsible for the styling of the navigation bar.
- `fixTransitions.js`: A JavaScript file used to fix and enhance CSS transitions within the website.
- `mainFeatures.js`: This script now includes core functionalities such as section navigation and the easter egg game, in addition to other dynamic features to enhance user interaction.

## Customizations and Features

### About the Website

The website has been fully customized to reflect my personal brand and information. All original content has been replaced with my own, including text, images, and other media. The site is structured into multiple pages, each dedicated to a different aspect of my personal and professional life:

1. **About Me**: A brief introduction to who I am.
2. **Education**: My educational background.
3. **Employment**: A summary of my work experience.
4. **Hobbies**: Things I enjoy doing in my spare time.

### Technical Details

**Q1: What are the five filenames in your README.md?**

The five main files in the project are:
1. `index.html`
2. `style.css`
3. `navbar.css`
4. `fixTransitions.js`
5. `mainFeatures.js`

**Q2: What is jQuery used for?**

jQuery was initially used in the website for simplifying DOM manipulation, handling events, and making Ajax calls. However, it has been removed to streamline the website's performance and rely on vanilla JavaScript for enhanced page speed and compatibility.

**Q3: Describe the functionality of your JavaScript code.**

The custom JavaScript code (`mainFeatures.js`) introduces an interactive easter egg in the form of a hidden game. When a specific key sequence (the Konami code) is entered, a simple clicker game appears, allowing users to engage with the website in a fun and unexpected way.

**Q4: Describe what your form would have done if you added server-side functionality.**

A contact form has been added to the website, intended to collect user inquiries and feedback. If server-side functionality were implemented, this form would capture the input data (name, email, message) and send it to a server-side script (e.g., PHP, Node.js) to process the information, possibly sending an email to my inbox or saving the data in a database for future reference.
